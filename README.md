# convertToMp3
This is a simple program that uses lame.exe intended to convert .wav to mp3 files. It was made using ps2exe (powershell to exe) so it may not run on systems with versions of powershell older than the one used to compile the .exe. There is .reg file included that will add the program as a Windows Explorer context item. Simply Right-click a file and select convertMp3. Mp3s should be converted in 320 kbps at a rate of 41.1 khz. I do not own the rights to lame.exe or ps2exe!
